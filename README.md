This is the Solution 1 of the IBM ANF CS Code Challenge.

#For Solution 1
#Step 1 : Clone this repository or download the same in ZIP format and extract the folders.
#Step 2 : Run the "npm install" command in the root folder path of the solution folder using your command prompt. This will install any dependency needed if any for that solution as per the package.json file.
#Step 3 : Once the installation is completed, run the "node server.js" or "nodemon server.js" (incase you have nodemon installed in your system beforehand, else the node command will suffice.)
#Step 4 : Go to your local browser (preferrably Google Chrome Version 90.0.4430.93 i.e. the latest build) and type in "http://localhost:3000/". You will get to see the Demo of the solution there.
